    {recipe_name: "Maple Pomegranate Glazed Short Ribs", ingredients: "
Ingredients\r\n\r\n

    3 pounds short ribs (that gave me 6 short ribs)\r\n
    himalayan sea salt, to taste\r\n
    garlic powder, to taste\r\n
    powdered ginger, to taste\r\n
    3 tablespoons Tin Star Ghee\r\n
    1 red onion, thinly sliced\r\n
    3 garlic cloves, minced\r\n
    3-4 cups beef broth\r\n
    1 cup pomegranate juice\r\n
    ¼ cup coconut aminos\r\n
    3 tablespoons maple syrup\r\n\r\n

For the glaze\r\n\r\n

    2 cup pomegranate juice\r\n
    ¼ cup maple syrup\r\n
    ¼ teaspoon powdered ginger\r\n\r\n

For the garnishes\r\n\r\n

    pomegranate seeds\r\n
    sliced green onions\r\n\r\n

Instructions\r\n\r\n

   1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Place a large dutch oven over medium heat. Add 3 tablespoons of ghee. Salt short ribs on all sides then sprinkle with a bit of garlic powder and ginger. Brown the ribs on all sides, about 1-2 minutes per side. Remove and set aside.\r\n
   2. Add onion and garlic to the pan and cook for about 2 minutes until onions become translucent. Add the broth, pomegranate juice, coconut aminos and maple syrup to the dutch oven and scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spatula then cover and let the pot come to boil.\r\n
   3. Once boiling, add the short ribs back to the pot into the liquid so they are completely submerged. Put lid on the dutch oven and into the preheated oven. Cook until the ribs are falling off the bone, about 3 hours. Remove the pan from the oven and let rest for 30 minutes with lid still on.\r\n
   4. When the ribs have 30 minutes to go, place a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add pomegranate juice, maple syrup and ginger to the pan and let bring to a low boil, whisking every couple minutes. The mixture will slowly start to reduce and thicken and in about 30 minutes, it will coat the back of the spoon. Be sure to not overcook because the mixture can become too thick and almost harden.\r\n
   5. Carefully remove short ribs from liquid, then top with glaze, pomegranate seeds and green onions.\r\n"},

	{recipe_name: "Slow Cooker Pot Roast With Easy Gravy", ingredients: "
Ingredients\r\n\r\n

    2 tablespoons Tin Star Ghee\r\n
    4 pound chuck roast, tied around the outside with twine\r\n
    Primal Palate Himalayan Sea Salt, to taste\r\n
    3 medium carrots, peeled and sliced\r\n
    3 medium parsnips, peeled and sliced\r\n
    1 medium yellow onion, cut into quarters\r\n
    3 garlic cloves, sliced\r\n
    1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme + extra sprigs\r\n
    pinch of black pepper\r\n
    2 Primal Palate Bay Leaves\r\n
    2 cups beef broth\r\n
    ⅓ cup red wine (optional)\r\n
    1 tablespoon honey\r\n
    ¼ cup tapioca or arrowroot flour\r\n
    1 batch of Cauliflower Puree on page 202 in Juli Bauer's Paleo Cookbook\r\n\r\n

Instructions\r\n\r\n

    1. Place a large cast iron skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add ghee. Sprinkle salt on chuck roast then sear on all sides, about 2-3 minutes per side. Place in slow cooker and put sliced carrots, parsnips and onion around the roast. Top the roast with garlic cloves, a bit more salt, thyme and thyme sprigs and black pepper. Put the bay leaves in the pot then pour in the beef broth and red wine. Cover and let cook for 8 hours on low.\r\n
    2. Once roast is done cooking, remove roast and place in a baking dish then use a slotted spoon to remove all the veggies and set in the baking dish with roast. Cover with foil to keep warm while you finish the dish.\r\n
    3. If you are making cauliflower puree, make it now.\r\n
    4. For the gravy: Dispose of bay leaves and thyme sprigs from slow cooker then use an immersion blender to puree broth in the bottom of the slow cooker. Once pureed, pour mixture into a large sauté pan and place it over medium heat. Add honey and whisk. Then while continuously mixing, add arrowroot or tapioca flour to the mixture, one teaspoon at a time. Be sure to continuously whisk because it can clump up. Once all flour is combined and gravy has thickened, pour mixture through a mesh strainer to get rid of any clumps.\r\n
    5. To serve pot roast: place cauliflower puree in a bowl along with veggies, pot roast that has been pulled apart with fork, and gravy on top!\r\n"},
